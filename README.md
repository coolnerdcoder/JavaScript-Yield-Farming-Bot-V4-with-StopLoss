# JavaScript-Yield-Farming-Bot-V4-with-StopLoss
High-yield farming bot with built-in stop loss function. The biggest asset of this program is the volatility stop loss also the biggest profit builder. When the program analyzes a downwards volatility it immediately pulls from all yield farms and sells into a stable coin which can be configured in the config.js file . It is default set to Ethereum chain USDC, BNB chain BUSD, Polygon USDC POS.   Configuring the bot is super simple and straightforward. There's nothing install is renting and simple pure JavaScript and makes all calls with Web3 runs locally on your computer. Another asset is your keys never leave your computer and you don't have to put a trust in a central authority. All swaps to stable coins are done on decentralized exchanges, Ethereum uses sushiswap, BNB uses pancakeswap, polygon uses quickswap.   This is open source and free all I ask is when you use this and you're happy with it if you happen to go to the codeathon please vote for me and this program.
